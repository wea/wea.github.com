			<h2>Goal</h2>
			The first international Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures (WEA2013) will be a venue for practitioners and researchers to share experience and lessons learned about architectures of software ecosystems as well as discuss current and future engineering challenges. Participants can expect to benefit from interesting and fruitful discussions, exchange their experiences, meet researchers working in the same area, and make new friends.
The workshop will be a highly interactive event, comprising the discussion of position papers, break-out groups, and plenary discussions.
			</p>

			<h2>Topics</h2>
				We solicit submissions on technical topics related to scaling system architecture to the level of software ecosystems. What are relevant methods, processes, techniques and/or tools for architecting at scale? Which technical strategies are required to cope with the complexity of ecosystem architectures? How can architectural concepts assure end-to-end quality across system borders while keeping maintenance and evolution of the comprising systems independent from each other? What kind of capabilities do we need in terms of tools to analyze software ecosystems statically or monitor/diagnose them at run time?

				<ul>
					<li>Experience reports on best practices for architectural styles, tactics, or patterns vs. bad smells or anti-patterns in ecosystem architectures </li>
					<li>Tools for inter-system static and/or dynamic analysis including but not limited to visualization, monitoring, and change awareness</li>

					<li>Empirical studies of ecosystem phenomena as well as user needs in the context of software development within an ecosystem</li>

					<li>Case studies of ecosystem architectures and their evolution </li>

					<li>Working Processes for evolving software ecosystems as a whole that respect the autonomy of independent system contributors </li>
					<li>Engineering methods for the design and documentation of evolving ecosystem architectures</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Proceedings</h2>
			Workshop proceedings will be published in the ACM digital library or as Fraunhofer IESE Technical Report and will be made available electronically to all participants.
